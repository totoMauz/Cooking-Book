# Cooking-Book
A small little application to teach myself rust. Progress will be slow and the implementation inefficient :)

Eventually this application will allow the user to
* Manage recipes and search them conveniently
* Get some insights into used recipes (calories or price per meal)
* Assign a recipe for a day of week and create a shoping cart out of it. The shopping cart will be grouped by 
  ingredients group (like vegetable or baking ingredient) to make shopping easier. If provided the shopping cart will 
  be also grouped by different stores if an ingredient is only available in a special place.
* A WebInterface will allow you to see the shopping cart in the store (where you actually need it) without printing or
  manually copying it
